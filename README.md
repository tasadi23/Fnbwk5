# 🧮 Week 5 – Building My First JavaScript App: The Calculator

Welcome to **Week 5** of the FNB App Academy!

Last week was a big one! I dove into **JavaScript** for the first time. It was definitely challenging, but I pushed through and came out with a solid understanding of how this language can make my apps interactive and dynamic. That alone is a big achievement, and I’m proud of the progress so far.

## 🔧 This Week’s Focus: Build a Calculator App

Now it’s time to **put everything I’ve learned to the test**. This week, I’m building my **first JavaScript-powered app**: a **fully functional calculator**.

This project is special because it combines all three core tools:

- **HTML** – for laying out the structure of the calculator (buttons, display screen, etc.)
- **CSS** – to make it look clean, organized, and user-friendly
- **JavaScript** – to handle all the logic behind the scenes (button clicks, number input, calculations)

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This isn't just another practice exercise, this is a **major milestone** in my developer journey. Here’s why:

- It’s the **first time** I’m building something that responds to users and performs real functionality.
- It challenges me to think logically, write clean code, and debug when things don’t work right away.
- It brings **all my skills together** this is where things start to feel real.

## 📝 My Game Plan

- Break the calculator down into pieces (HTML first, then styling, then JavaScript)
- Start small, get the numbers showing up, then add operations
- Test as I go, small wins build momentum
- Don’t rush. I’m here to **build**, not just finish.

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This is the kind of app I used to see and wonder, *"How do people build that?"* Now, I get to answer that question by doing it myself.

Time to write some real logic, hit some bugs, fix them, and come out the other side with a working calculator I built from scratch. Let’s go! ⚡

📇 Week 6 – Contact Book App & Working with APIs
Welcome to Week 6 of the FNB App Academy and the final week of the Intermediate Phase!

The last two weeks have been a serious level-up. I’ve been juggling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve managed to build real functionality into my apps. That alone is something to be proud of — it's not easy to switch between three different languages and keep your head straight. But I did it.

🔥 This Week’s Challenge: The Contact Book App
Now it’s time to push things even further.

This week’s project is my most advanced one yet: building a fully functional Contact Book app. But here’s the twist, instead of manually adding contact info into the code, this app will connect to an API to pull real data from an external database.

That means I'm stepping into the world of dynamic data and remote communication, which is a huge milestone.

🌐 What’s an API, and Why Does It Matter?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is basically a bridge that lets my app talk to other services. It’s how modern apps:

Get live weather info
Pull user profiles
Show social media feeds
Search databases,like I’ll be doing with contacts
By learning how to work with APIs, I’m unlocking one of the most powerful tools in modern web development.

🎯 My Focus for the Week
Understand how to make requests and handle responses in JavaScript
Learn about fetching data, JSON formatting, and rendering that data into HTML
Combine all three core skills — structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) to make something that feels real and dynamic
✅ Final Thoughts
This week marks the end of the Intermediate Phase and what a journey it’s been. I’ve gone from building static pages to creating interactive, data-driven apps. The Contact Book app is more than just another project. It’s a statement: I can build something that talks to the internet.

And that’s a big deal.

Let’s finish strong. 💪📱
