# 🧮 Week 5 – Building My First JavaScript App: The Calculator

Welcome to **Week 5** of the FNB App Academy!

Last week was a big one! I dove into **JavaScript** for the first time. It was definitely challenging, but I pushed through and came out with a solid understanding of how this language can make my apps interactive and dynamic. That alone is a big achievement, and I’m proud of the progress so far.

## 🔧 This Week’s Focus: Build a Calculator App

Now it’s time to **put everything I’ve learned to the test**. This week, I’m building my **first JavaScript-powered app**: a **fully functional calculator**.

This project is special because it combines all three core tools:

- **HTML** – for laying out the structure of the calculator (buttons, display screen, etc.)
- **CSS** – to make it look clean, organized, and user-friendly
- **JavaScript** – to handle all the logic behind the scenes (button clicks, number input, calculations)

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This isn't just another practice exercise, this is a **major milestone** in my developer journey. Here’s why:

- It’s the **first time** I’m building something that responds to users and performs real functionality.
- It challenges me to think logically, write clean code, and debug when things don’t work right away.
- It brings **all my skills together** this is where things start to feel real.

## 📝 My Game Plan

- Break the calculator down into pieces (HTML first, then styling, then JavaScript)
- Start small, get the numbers showing up, then add operations
- Test as I go, small wins build momentum
- Don’t rush. I’m here to **build**, not just finish.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This is the kind of app I used to see and wonder, *"How do people build that?"* Now, I get to answer that question by doing it myself.

Time to write some real logic, hit some bugs, fix them, and come out the other side with a working calculator I built from scratch. Let’s go! ⚡
